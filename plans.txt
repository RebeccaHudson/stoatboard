I'll need the following things:

   * a 'back end' library that can take 
     a map with some GIS data ; initially TOPO data but STOP SIGNS matter also.
     a few parameters, maybe
    and calculate one or more sick ass routes to shred.

   * a rails app that uses this library and stores results
     and outputs a JSON block containing the results of the calculation.

   * a leaflet JS project frontend that displays these routes on maps and provides controls.
  

   start with 4 modes: 
     default: longest continual downgrade within N %
     agressive: steepest downgrade.
     mellow: shallowest downgrade. 
     circiut: routes that provide a quick walk back to the top for a long downgrade, like a waterslide type thing.
